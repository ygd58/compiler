## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `#[tx_script]` entrypoints now take typed script arguments: the entrypoint is a free function
  of any name whose by-value parameter can be any `ScriptArgs` type (every
  `FromFeltRepr + ToFeltRepr` type qualifies, e.g. `Felt`, `Word`, or a user struct deriving
  both) and is decoded automatically from the `TX_SCRIPT_ARGS` word — packed directly in the
  args word when the encoding statically fits its 4 felts, or fetched from the advice provider
  and hash-verified against the args word otherwise. The parameters may appear in any order
  (the account reference is optional); existing `fn run(arg: Word, ...)` signatures keep
  compiling and behave unchanged. On the host, `ScriptArgs::encode` on a struct with the
  identical layout yields the args word or the advice-map preimage (`EncodedScriptArgs`). The
  trait lives in the new `miden-tx-script-args` crate (re-exported from `miden`), which
  off-chain code can depend on without pulling in any on-chain SDK crates. See the
  [migration guide](./sdk/MIGRATION.md) for adopting typed arguments #1291
- `Tag`, `NoteType`, `Recipient`, and `Asset` now implement `FromFeltRepr`/`ToFeltRepr`
  (and `AccountId` gained `ToFeltRepr`), so they can be used as fields of derived
  script-argument structs. The `miden` crate additionally re-exports `miden_field_repr` under
  its own crate name, so the derives' generated code resolves in crates that only depend on
  `miden` and glob-import it #1291

### Migration and breaking changes

- `FromFeltRepr` has a new required associated constant `FIXED_LEN: Option<usize>` — the
  statically known encoded length in felts, used by `ScriptArgs` to pick the transport mode at
  compile time. `#[derive(FromFeltRepr)]` computes it automatically; only manual trait
  implementations must add it. See the [migration guide](./sdk/MIGRATION.md) #1291

## [0.14.0-rc.1]

### Added

- `AssetAmount` and `AssetAmountError` provide validated fungible amounts bounded by
  `AssetAmount::MAX_U64` (`2^63 - 2^31`), with checked construction and conversions, integer
  ordering, and addition and subtraction that panic on overflow or underflow. `AssetAmount` can be
  used in exported component signatures and typed account storage. `Asset::amount()` returns a
  fungible asset's typed amount, while `Asset::is_fungible()` lets mixed-asset code check before
  calling it #999
- `FromFeltRepr` and `ToFeltRepr` are implemented for `Word`, encoding its four felt elements in
  order, so `Word` can be used directly in `#[note]` storage and other felt-representation derives
  #886
- `#[account(...)]` references accept `as Alias` to rename the generated component trait, for
  example `#[account(counter_contract::CounterContract as RemoteCounter)]`. Aliases must be
  UpperCamelCase and can resolve clashes with the wrapper name, another generated trait, or a
  sibling component trait #1208
- Account components may export a method named `new`. `Wallet::new(account_id)` remains the
  foreign-account constructor, while `wallet.new()` calls the component method #1208

### Fixed

- `#[account(...)]` now keeps canonical dependency WIT interfaces unchanged, fixing rare
  component-link failures when plain note, transaction-script, or sibling imports of a dependency
  are linked with generated FPI bindings. FPI bindings now also preserve anonymous compound types
  and allow repeated wrappers to coexist, including wrappers that select different dependency
  sets #1276

### Migration and breaking changes

- `#[account(...)]` now generates one trait per referenced interface, with the wrapper's
  visibility, instead of generating inherent methods on the wrapper. Import the generated trait at
  cross-module call sites. Rename a wrapper that has the same name as its generated trait, or use
  `as Alias`. Use distinct aliases for other generated-trait name clashes, and disambiguate
  overlapping methods with `<Wallet as Interface>::method(account, ...)`. To select an overlapping
  built-in method, import `miden::active_account::ActiveAccount` and use
  `<Wallet as ActiveAccount>::method(account, ...)`. Every referenced interface must export at
  least one callable function; empty references that were previously ignored are now rejected
  #1208
- `#[account(...)]` wrapper structs are supported only at module scope so their generated component
  metadata has a stable identity. Move wrappers declared inside a function or block to the
  enclosing module.
- Component methods must now be marked `#[account_procedure]` on the `#[component]` trait to remain
  callable from notes, transaction scripts, FPI, or sibling components. Unmarked methods remain
  exported but are not account procedures. Authentication components continue to use
  `#[auth_script]`; a component cannot combine the two markers.
- Kernel scalar APIs now use domain or integer types instead of raw `Felt`:
  - `tx::get_block_number()` returns `BlockNumber`; convert stored felts with
    `BlockNumber::try_from`, and use `as_felt()`, `as_u32()`, or `Into<Felt>` where a raw value is
    needed. `as_u32()` panics rather than truncating if a value constructed through component
    bindings exceeds the `u32` block-height limit.
  - `tx::get_block_timestamp()` returns `u32` seconds.
  - `tx::get_expiration_block_delta()` returns `u16`, with `0` meaning unset;
    `update_expiration_block_delta()` takes `u16`, and set deltas are restricted to
    `1..=u16::MAX`.
  - `active_account::get_nonce()` and `native_account::incr_nonce()` return `Nonce`; use
    `as_felt()`, `as_u64()`, or `Into<Felt>` where a raw value is needed.
  - `tx::get_num_input_notes()`, `tx::get_num_output_notes()`,
    `active_account::get_num_procedures()`, and the `num_assets` or `num_storage_items` fields of
    `OutputNoteAssetsInfo`, `InputNoteAssetsInfo`, and `InputNoteStorageInfo` return `u32`.
    `active_account::get_procedure_root()` now takes a `u32` index instead of `u8`.
  - Attachment lookup functions return `Option<u32>` instead of `AttachmentLocation`, and
    `write_attachment_to_memory()` and `write_indexed_attachment_to_memory()` bindings take `u32`
    indexes instead of `Felt`.
- SDK bindings now target VM v0.25 and the protocol 0.16 transaction-kernel API:
  - Rename `active_note::get_assets()` to `get_initial_assets()`, `input_note::get_assets()` to
    `get_initial_assets()`, and `input_note::get_assets_info()` to `get_initial_assets_info()`.
    These functions read the note's creation-time assets, unaffected by in-transaction removal.
  - Replace `active_account::has_non_fungible_asset(asset)` with `has_asset(asset_id)`, which takes
    a `Word` asset ID and tests membership for either fungible or non-fungible assets.
  - Move `get_initial_commitment()`, `get_initial_storage_commitment()`,
    `get_initial_vault_root()`, and `get_initial_asset()` from `active_account` and the
    `ActiveAccount` trait to `native_account` free functions. `storage::get_initial_item()` and
    `storage::get_initial_map_item()` keep their Rust API but now read the native account's initial
    state.
  - Remove `active_account::{get_balance, get_initial_balance}`,
    `faucet::{create_fungible_asset, create_non_fungible_asset, has_callbacks}`, and the `asset`
    module. Read asset values with `active_account::get_asset()` or
    `native_account::get_initial_asset()`; assets passed to `faucet::{mint, burn}` must be
    constructed outside the transaction.
  - `output_note::create()` is now runtime-restricted to account-component context. Note and
    transaction scripts must call an account-component wrapper to create notes.
- `midenc-frontend-wasm-metadata` now stores a list of metadata entries. Replace
  `FrontendMetadata::{to_bytes, from_bytes}` with `encode_section(&entries)` and
  `decode_section(bytes)`, which returns `Vec<FrontendMetadata>`. The serialized payload is now a
  JSON list, and exhaustive matches must handle the new `FrontendMetadata::{AccountProcedure,
  TxScript}` and `ProtocolExportKind::{AccountProcedure, TxScript}` variants.
