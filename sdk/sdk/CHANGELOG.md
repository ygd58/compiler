## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING
- Component methods must now be explicitly marked `#[account_procedure]` to be part of the account
  interface (callable as account procedures from transaction scripts, notes, foreign procedure
  invocation, and sibling components). Previously every lifted non-auth/note/tx component export was
  implicitly an account procedure. Unmarked methods remain exported but are no longer part of the
  account interface. Authentication components keep using `#[auth_script]` (its method is the
  account interface implicitly); `#[auth_script]` and `#[account_procedure]` belong to different
  component kinds and cannot be combined in one component. See the [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md).
- `#[account(...)]` now generates the component methods as one trait per referenced interface
  (named after the interface, with the wrapper's visibility, implemented for the wrapper) instead
  of inherent methods on the wrapper struct. Two components that export the same method name can
  therefore coexist on one wrapper; a shared method name is no longer a compile error and is called
  with `<Wallet as Interface>::method(account, ..)`. Two consequences for existing code: the
  wrapper struct must be named differently from every generated trait (e.g.
  `#[account(counter_contract::CounterContract)] struct CounterContract;` no longer compiles —
  rename the struct, or use `as` (see Added) to rename the trait), and a component method that
  shares a name with an `ActiveAccount` built-in (e.g. `get_id`) no longer shadows it —
  disambiguate with `<Wallet as Interface>::get_id(account)`, or (with
  `use miden::active_account::ActiveAccount;` in scope) `<Wallet as ActiveAccount>::get_id(account)`.
  Single-component accounts whose method names do not overlap keep calling `account.method(..)`
  unchanged when the generated trait is in scope — a same-module entrypoint sees it automatically;
  a cross-module call site needs a `use` of the generated trait. Relatedly, a component method
  named `new` is now permitted (previously a hard error): it lives on the generated trait and
  coexists with the inherent `Wallet::new(account_id)` constructor #1208
- SDK bindings updated for VM v0.25 / protocol v0.16.0-beta.1. Several tx-kernel bindings were
  renamed, moved, or removed to match the protocol. See the [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md).
  - Renamed `active_note::get_assets` -> `get_initial_assets`, `input_note::get_assets` ->
    `get_initial_assets`, and `input_note::get_assets_info` -> `get_initial_assets_info`; these
    return the note's creation-time assets, unaffected by in-transaction removal.
  - `active_account::has_non_fungible_asset(asset: Asset)` (and the `ActiveAccount` trait method)
    became `has_asset(asset_id: Word)`, testing any-asset membership by asset id.
  - Moved `get_initial_commitment`, `get_initial_storage_commitment`, `get_initial_vault_root`,
    and `get_initial_asset` from `active_account` (and the `ActiveAccount` trait) to
    `native_account` free functions. `storage::{get_initial_item, get_initial_map_item}` keep
    their API but now read the native account's initial state.
  - Removed `active_account::{get_balance, get_initial_balance}`,
    `faucet::{create_fungible_asset, create_non_fungible_asset, has_callbacks}`, and the whole
    `asset` module. The kernel no longer exposes in-transaction asset construction;
    `faucet::{mint, burn}` take a pre-built `Asset`.
  - `output_note::create` can now only be called from account-component context (runtime-enforced);
    tx/note scripts create notes through an account component wrapper method.

### Added
- `#[account(...)]` references accept an `as Alias` to rename the generated trait, e.g.
  `#[account(counter_contract::CounterContract as RemoteCounter)]`. The path still selects the
  interface; only the generated trait is renamed. Use it when the interface name would clash with
  the wrapper struct, with another referenced interface, or with a sibling `#[component(...)]`
  trait of the same interface in the same crate #1208

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- `*_note::get_metadata` now returns a single-`Word` `NoteMetadata { header: Word }` (the note
  metadata header) instead of two words; the note attachment is no longer part of the metadata.
  Retrieve attachments via `*_note::{get_attachments_commitment, find_attachment,
  write_attachment_commitments_to_memory, write_attachment_to_memory}` instead. See the
  [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md).
- The stack return areas of `stdlib::crypto::hashes::{hash_elements, hash_words, blake3_merge,
  sha256_merge}`, `intrinsics::crypto::merge`, `stdlib::mem::{pipe_words_to_memory,
  pipe_double_words_to_memory}`, and of all protocol bindings returning `Word`-based values
  (account/note/tx/storage/asset/faucet getters and `execute_foreign_procedure`) are now
  word-aligned. Previously they were under-aligned, so a call could trap at
  runtime with `assertion failed with error code: 0` when the compiler emitted a word-granular
  access to the returned value, depending on how the calling function's stack frame happened to
  be laid out.
- `active_note::get_storage` and the `get_assets` / `write_attachment_commitments_to_memory` /
  `write_attachment_to_memory` getters on `active_note`/`input_note`/`output_note` now match the
  transaction-kernel ABI, which returns a single count value. The compiler previously modeled a
  second (pointer) return value the kernel no longer provides, which could corrupt the VM operand
  stack at run time.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-29

### BREAKING
- SDK bindings updated for VM v0.23 / protocol v0.15 (`miden-field` bumped to `^0.25`). `Felt::new`
  is now fallible: it returns `Result<Felt, _>` instead of `Felt`, so `Felt::new(x)` becomes
  `Felt::new(x).unwrap()` (or handle the error).
- `asset::{create_fungible_asset, create_non_fungible_asset}` now take an
  `enable_callbacks: bool` argument.
- `active_account::{get_balance, get_initial_balance}` and the corresponding
  `ActiveAccount` trait methods now take an asset key `Word` instead of a
  faucet `AccountId`.
- `faucet::{mint, burn}` no longer return an `Asset`, and the
  `faucet::{mint_value, burn_value}` helpers were removed to match the tx
  kernel API.
- `output_note::set_attachment` was removed. The attachment shape is now selected by function
  rather than a runtime `attachment_kind` argument: use
  `output_note::add_word_attachment(note_idx, attachment_scheme, attachment)` for a single word,
  `add_attachment` for a commitment, or `add_attachment_from_memory` for a multi-word attachment.
- The auto-generated `crate::bindings::Account` struct is removed. Declare the account
  explicitly with `#[account(...)]` and use that type as the note/tx-script entrypoint account
  parameter #1157
- `#[component]` no longer applies to structs or inherent impl blocks. An account component is
  now written as a `#[component_storage]` struct declaring the storage fields, a `#[component]`
  trait declaring the API, and a `#[component] impl Trait for Storage` block providing the
  behavior. The WIT interface name derives from the trait name, and `[lib].namespace` in
  `miden-project.toml` must equal the full `miden:<package>/<interface>@<version>` id (package
  from the kebab-cased `[package].name`, version from `miden-project.toml`) #697
- Storage slot names now derive from the `[lib].namespace` interface segment instead of the
  storage struct name. Slot names feed `StorageSlotId` derivation, so a component whose storage
  struct name does not match the interface segment gets different slot ids on recompile. Note
  that this also means renaming the component trait (and updating `[lib].namespace` to match)
  re-keys the storage slot ids of an already-deployed component #697
- `#[account(...)]` dependency references now require the dependency's exported WIT interface:
  write `#[account(counter_contract::CounterContract)]` instead of
  `#[account(counter_contract)]`. The interface segment is kebab-cased and validated against the
  interfaces the dependency's generated WIT exports #697

### Added
- `#[component(package::Interface, ...)]` on the component trait declares sibling component
  dependencies — other components deployed on the same account. Each reference generates a
  `pub trait` named after the interface whose default methods call the sibling component through
  the Wasm component-model boundary (an intra-account cross-context `call`, the same mechanism
  note scripts use to call the account). The generated traits attach to `#[component_storage]`
  structs automatically and may be declared as supertraits of the component trait. Each sibling
  package must be a declared dependency, and its generated WIT must be reachable through
  `[package.metadata.miden.dependencies].<name>.wit` in `miden-project.toml` (the same entry FPI
  dependencies use) #697
- `#[component]` traits may declare supertraits (e.g. `NativeAccount` and generated sibling
  traits) #697
- `#[account(...)]` on an empty struct generates a typed account wrapper exposing the methods
  of the account component packages listed in the attribute. The same type serves both as the
  transaction's native (active) account — when passed to a `#[note]`/`#[tx_script]` entrypoint —
  and as a foreign account caller created with `new(account_id)`, whose method calls are routed
  through `execute_foreign_procedure` (FPI) #1157
  For example:
  ```rust
  let counter = CounterContract::new(counter_account_id);
  let count = counter.get_count();
  ```
- Added tx-kernel SDK bindings for `native_account::get_id` and
  `tx::get_tx_script_root`.
- Added `AttachmentLocation` for note attachment lookup results.
- Added active-note bindings:
  `active_note::{is_public, is_private, get_attachments_commitment, write_attachment_commitments_to_memory, write_attachment_to_memory, find_attachment}`.
- Added note attachment and metadata bindings:
  `note::{compute_and_store_recipient, compute_storage_commitment, write_attachment_commitments_to_memory, write_attachment_to_memory, write_indexed_attachment_to_memory, compute_recipient, metadata_into_sender, metadata_into_attachment_schemes, metadata_into_note_type, metadata_into_tag, find_attachment_idx}`.
- Added input-note bindings:
  `input_note::{get_attachments_commitment, get_attachments_commitment_raw, write_attachment_commitments_to_memory, write_attachment_to_memory, find_attachment}`.
- Added output-note bindings:
  `output_note::{add_word_attachment, add_attachment, add_attachment_from_memory, get_attachments_commitment, find_attachment, write_attachment_commitments_to_memory, write_attachment_to_memory}`.
- Added `faucet::has_callbacks`.
- `println!` macro (and `debug::println`) for emitting a debug message during execution.

### BREAKING
- Note scripts now use a struct-based API: replace `#[note_script] fn run(...)` with `#[note]` on a note input `struct` and `#[note]` on an inherent `impl` block containing exactly one `#[note_script]` entrypoint method #890. See an example: [before](https://github.com/0xMiden/project-template/blob/6cd50a3312dffba1826fd4f812bc431da7f51d5f/contracts/increment-note/src/lib.rs) and [after](https://github.com/0xMiden/project-template/blob/1dd023311021800002e3a9fb687e936991877e65/contracts/increment-note/src/lib.rs).
